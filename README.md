# KonversiFinalProject_Prince_OOP
I made this application at summer in 2016 in order 
to complete Final test of Object Oriented Programming 
when I took that class at University of Klabat. 
The lecturer name was Sir. Sevendi Eldrige Rifki Poluan. 
This project is advanced converter desktop application with 
interactive character(Live2d/GIF) using 
JAVA Language Programming and NETBEANS software as it environment. 
This application consist of error handling, subnetting, primary number, 
advanced and interactive converter that using character as little guidance 
and also, she's cute.

HOW TO START THIS APPLICATION ?
1. I suggest to use netbeans or IntellijIdea (in this case I used Intellij IDEA)
2. Select the SDK first
3. Go to KonversiFinalProject_Prince_OOP
4. Go to src
5. Go to konversifinalproject_prince_oop
6. Look at the YourName.java , then start it from there
7. If you confuse how to start from there, then just right click on it(or the file, on your IDE) then run 'YourName.main()'
8. Just run the YourName java and then programm will asking for "Masukan Nama Anda", which is input your name, so the character can greet you with your name
